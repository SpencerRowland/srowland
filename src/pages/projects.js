            Escape Kit began with the mission to make a better digital waiver for the escape room industry.
            It has grown to become an automated marketing tool used by escape room businesses across the country.

          <p>
            AutomatedRE was a solution borne out of the pain of review collection through TripAdvisor. Using selenium
            with headless chrome in Django, AutomatedRE pulls emails from a connected Mailchimp list and submits them to TripAdvisor
            Review Express.

            The website for my escape room business was my first project to see any type of real traffic. The business site has
            changed after the sale but I have saved it here for posterity. Originally written in nothing but HTML, CSS and
            a smattering of JavaScript and JQuery. Its current iteration is in React with the help of Gatsby.

            A simple static website for a friendâ€™s business. Built and designed from scratch and
